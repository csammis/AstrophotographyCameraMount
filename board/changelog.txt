CHANGELOG

Revision 3:
    Schematic:
    * Fix: Swap pins 7/8 from MSP430 into pins 10/11 on A3967

Revision 2:
    Schematic:
    * Fix: Tie A3967 /ENABLE to GND
    * Change: Update connector footprints to JST-XH
    * Add: inline resistors to A3967 /ENABLE, /RESET, and /SLEEP
    * Add: PD resistors to STEP and DIR
    * Add: test points to GND and 3.3V
    * Add: jumpers to enable driving GND and 3.3V from ez-FET
    * Add: Two switches for user input control

    PCB:
    * Change: Enlarged board to accomodate JST headers and pushbuttons
    * Change: Reduced via count where possible by routing traces to
              headers on B.Cu instead of jumping back up to F.Cu
    * Change: Shortened traces from pads to power plane vias

Revision 1:
    * Initial Release
